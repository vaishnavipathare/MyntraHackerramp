# Solutions

# Snapchat Filters
We created custom filters in Lens Studio and integrated them with Snapchat to enhance the shopping experience for Myntra's users. There are two QR codes involved in this integration. The first QR code, when scanned, directs users straight to the Myntra website, facilitating easy access to the online store. The second QR code opens a Snapchat lens directly, allowing users to try on a specific top or product virtually. This AR try-on feature enables users to see how the product looks on them in real-time.

# Chatbot
A chatbot that can answer all queries about order tracking, payment, and more. One key feature is its ability to provide direct access to ongoing sales on Myntra. Many people aren't aware of these sales, so our chatbot includes links that redirect users to the specific sales pages they're interested in.

# You Tube Data Analysis And Recommendation
This project leverages YouTube data and machine learning to create a personalized recommendation system.It aims to boost user interaction with Myntra through strategic video content recommendations, enhancing overall user experience and engagement.
